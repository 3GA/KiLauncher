A full-screen launcher

Abstract
========

KiLauncher is a static full-screen launcher menu.  It features:

- Themeable appearance using (a subset of) CSS
- Static configuration
- Plaintext YAML configuration file
- Support for XDG .desktop launcher files

KiLauncher is aimed at situations where you want to provide a user with a simple, limited interface to an explicit set of applications.  It's possibly useful for:

- Kiosks (hence the name), CyberCafe, or other publicly-accessible computers
- Computers for children or computer novices who just want to launch a few programs easily
- Call centers, labs, POS systems, or other "locked down" workstations

What KiLauncher is NOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It's not a desktop environment, window manager, task manager, or desktop shell.  Just a launcher.
- It's not a total lockdown solution.  You still need to address the lockdown of your desktop, launched programs, etc.
- It's not a dynamically-updating menu replacement that will automagically configure new launchers for you.
- It's not tested on platforms other than GNU/Linux on a regular basis.
