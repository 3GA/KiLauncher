----------------------
A full-screen launcher
----------------------

Abstract
========

KiLauncher is a static full-screen launcher menu.  It features:

- Themeable appearance using (a subset of) CSS
- Static configuration
- Plaintext YAML configuration file
- Support for XDG .desktop launcher files

KiLauncher is aimed at situations where you want to provide a user with a simple, limited interface to an explicit set of applications.  It's possibly useful for:

- Kiosks (hence the name), CyberCafe, or other publicly-accessible computers
- Computers for children or computer novices who just want to launch a few programs easily
- Call centers, labs, POS systems, or other "locked down" workstations

What KiLauncher is NOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It's not a desktop environment, window manager, task manager, or desktop shell.  Just a launcher.
- It's not a total lockdown solution.  You still need to address the lockdown of your desktop, launched programs, etc.
- It's not a dynamically-updating menu replacement that will automagically configure new launchers for you.
- It's not tested on platforms other than GNU/Linux on a regular basis.

Requirements
============

- python
- pyqt4
- python-yaml
- python-xdg

Usage
=====

The program is still kind of in alpha state, so the exact usage is in flux.  

The kilauncher.yaml file is the configuration file, and is well commented to show how shortcuts can be configured.  Basically, you can give it directories full of .desktop files, individual .desktop files, or explicit name/comment/icon/command values to define launchers for each tab.

The stylesheet.css file is where the style info is kept.  It uses QT Stylesheet code, NOT regular CSS.  It's close, but the former is a subset so not everything works, and some things don't work like you'd expect.

The current command line options available are:

Switch         Description

-c, --config   Specify a configuration file to use

Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, as long as they keep the software developing along the same intended functions.  Some key points:

- the menu needs to remain static and hand-configurable (explicit configuration enables an administrator to control what's launchable)
- the appearance also needs to be hand-configurable
- Generally speaking, it needs to be appropriate for a public or locked-down kiosk
